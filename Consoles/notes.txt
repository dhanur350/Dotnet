What is diffeence between C# and .NET
CLR(Common Language Runtime)
Architecture of .NET Application
Our first C# Application

Difference between C# and .NET Framework
C# is a programming language
.NET is a framework for building applications on Windows
.NET consist of two components CLR(Common Language Runtime) and Class Library
CLR 
CLR basically converts the converted programming code i.e. Intermediate language code into Native machine code and this process is called JIT(Just in time compilation)
Arcintecture of .NET application
.NET applications at a application consist of biulding blocks called classes and these calsses collaborate with each other at a runtime and as a result the application provides some functionality 
A class is a collection of data members and member functions
As the number of classes grow we need to organize these classes that's where we use a namespace so a namespace is a continer for related classes , eg:- in a .NET framework we have namespaces each contains tens of related classes , we have namespaces for working with data like databases , we also have namespaces for working with graphics and images , we have namespaces for working with security.
Now in the real world application as these namespaces grow we need a different way to partitioning an application , and that's where we need an assembly.
An assembly is a container for related namespaces.
Physically it's a file on the disk which can either be an executable .EXE or a DLL which stands for (Dynamically Linked Library). 
So when you compile an application a compiler builds one or more assembly depending on how you partition your code.
The C Sharp or C# is a very simple console application without graphical user interface (GUI) and
